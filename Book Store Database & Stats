create table books (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, item TEXT, price INTEGER, quantity INTEGER );
INSERT INTO books VALUES (1, "INUYASHA", 9.99, 5);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (2, "DGRAYMAN",7.99, 3);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (3, "SOUL EATER", 12.99 , 4);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (4, "DOROHEDORO", 11.99 , 3);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (5,"HUNTERXHUNTER", 9.99, 2);
SELECT * FROM books
order by price desc;
SELECT SUM (quantity) FROM books



First I created a book store database then listed the items I have for sale.
After listing the Title of the books, Price & quantity I organized the books by price in descending order 
Next, I totalled the sum from the quantity of books I have for sale in my book store
